A Minecraft: Java Edition launcher library partially made with elements from PojavLauncher.

This library was initially meant for use in QuestCraft but has turned into the perfect library for Minecraft: Java Edition launchers. This includes everything needed for a basic and (soon) even advanced MCJE launchers written in Java (or any other language with interop).
